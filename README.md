#Neural Network Interface on FPGA

The weights for Neuron connections are trained under Mtalab using Levenberg-Marquardt.

A 32-30-10 Neural network is implemented on Intel DE1-SOC FPGA to classify digit numbers from MNIST database. Testing data transfered from my labtop to SD card on FPGA.\
The final testing accuracy on FPGA is 69%.
